## 1_ Python Basics

### About

Python is a high-level programming langage. I can be used in a wide range of works.

Commonly used in data-science, [Pytho](https://www.python.org/)  has a huge set of libraries, helpful to quickly do something.

Most of informatics systems already support Python, without installing anything.

### Install a library

Python actually has two mainly used distributions. Python2 and python3.

You can install a library with [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip?).

__python2__ : sudo pip install [PCKG_NAME]
