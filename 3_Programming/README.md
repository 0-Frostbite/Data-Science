## 1_ Python Basics

### About

Python is a high-level programming langage. I can be used in a wide range of works.

Commonly used in data-science, [Pytho](https://www.python.org/)  has a huge set of libraries, helpful to quickly do something.

Most of informatics systems already support Python, without installing anything.

### Execute a script

* Download the .py file on your computer
* Make it executable (_chmod +x file.py_ on Linux)
* Open a terminal and go to the directory containing the python file
* _python file.py_ to run with Python2 or _python3 file.py_ with Python3

### Install a library

Python actually has two mainly used distributions. Python2 and python3.

You can install a library with [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip?).

__python2__ : sudo pip install [PCKG_NAME]

__python3__ : sudo pip3 install [PCKG_NAME]
